# The Marauder's Map

#### Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I’ve always thought the Marauder’s Map in Harry Potter was the coolest thing ever. I mean, who wouldn’t want to know where everyone’s sneaking off to?

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This is my humble attempt to make my own version, inspired by the legendary mischief of the original creators: Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind, it shows moving footsteps, hidden rooms, and lets you pan around the map; a little bit of digital magic and mischief, without the risk of being caught by Filch.
